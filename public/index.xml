      <description>Goats- I used html instead of .md on this pageThe domestic goat or simply goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of C. aegagrus domesticated from the wildgoat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamilyCaprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.[1] Goats are oneof the oldest domesticated species of animal, and have been used for milk, meat, fur and skins across much of theworld.</description>
