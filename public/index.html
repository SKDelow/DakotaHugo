    <h1>Dakota Berg - Life Story</h1>
    <p>
        Dakota Berg looked at the rusted rock in his hands and felt irritable.

        He walked over to the window and reflected on his damp surroundings. He had always hated cold millennium
        falcon with its ratty, rough rust bucket. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel irritable.

        Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Mark Blackman. Mark was a
        creepy animal with spiky abs and fat feet.

        Dakota gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a snotty, smart, cocoa drinker with slimy abs and
        ginger feet. His friends saw him as a helpful, hurt hero. Once, he had even brought a hissing injured bird
        back from the brink of death.

        But not even a snotty person who had once brought a hissing injured bird back from the brink of death, was
        prepared for what Mark had in store today.

        The snow flurried like talking frogs, making Dakota stressed.

        As Dakota stepped outside and Mark came closer, he could see the spilt glint in his eye.

        "I am here because I want wifi password," Mark bellowed, in a friendly tone. He slammed his fist against
        Dakota's chest, with the force of 1516 donkeys. "I frigging hate you, Dakota Berg."

        Dakota looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the rusted rock. "Mark, dakota, I am your
        father," he replied.

        They looked at each other with worried feelings, like two homely, high humming birds laughing at a very
        brave birthday party, which had classical music playing in the background and two patient uncles jogging to
        the beat.

        Dakota regarded Mark's spiky abs and fat feet. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered,
        gently.

        "Hmph," pondered Mark.

        "Please?" begged Dakota with puppy dog eyes.

        Mark looked jumpy, his body blushing like a barbecued, bumpy banana.

        Then Mark came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.
