<p>
	The <strong>domestic</strong> goat or simply goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of C. aegagrus domesticated from the wild
	goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamily
	Caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.[1] Goats are one
	of the oldest domesticated species of animal, and have been used for milk, meat, fur and skins across much of the
	world.[2] Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.

	Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males are called bucks or billies and juvenile goats of both
	sexes are called kids. Castrated males are called wethers. While the words hircine and caprine both refer to
	anything having a goat-like quality, hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats.
